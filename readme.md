# 🌸 Project Nova

## A Fully Local AI Companion with Memory, Emotion, Voice, Avatar Control, and Agentic Abilities

**Project Nova** is a fully local, real-time AI companion designed to feel persistent, emotionally aware, and interactive.  
It combines a fine-tuned large language model, long-term memory, expressive text-to-speech, speech recognition, and live 3D avatar control — all optimized to run on consumer hardware.

- #### Scroll below to see the instructions for setting up Nova as a Discord Bot. 

---
> ⚠️ **Development Disclaimer**
>
> Project Nova was **not created using “vibe coding” or fully AI-generated code**.
>
> The system architecture, core logic, threading model, memory design, agentic behavior, and debugging were **designed, implemented, and validated manually**.
> 
>Time Taken for development (approx 2 months)
>
> AI tools were used **only as a support resource** for:
> - Understanding unfamiliar concepts (eg. Threading, RAG)
> - Exploring alternative approaches (eg. Chunking, Streaming TTS)
> - Identifying potential issues
>
> When automated suggestions failed or were incorrect, **all debugging, fixes, and final decisions were performed manually**.
>
> This project reflects hands-on engineering, iterative testing, and deliberate system design — not prompt-to-project generation.


## ✨ Core Features

### 🧠 Long-Term Memory (RAG-Based)

- Persistent memory powered by **ChromaDB**
- Semantic embeddings enable **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**
- Supports:
  - Explicit memories (user asks Nova to remember)
  - Episodic / emotional memories
  - Contextual recall during conversation
- Latest memories are injected at startup to maintain continuity across sessions

> Memory is semantic, persistent, and local — no hard-coded state.

---

 ### 🤖 Language Model (LLM)

- Uses a **Phi-3.5 fine-tuned model**  (4B parameters, Q4_K_M quantization)
- Fine-tuned on a **custom conversational dataset using Google Collab**
- Optimized for
  - Structured JSON output
  - Consistent personality
  - Low-latency local inference
- Runs locally via [Ollama](https://ollama.com)
- Enforced **structured JSON output**:
- Model is available at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Navpy/phi-3.5-AI-Vtuber-json)

```json
{
  "response": "text",
  "emotion": "emotion_name"
}
```

- Low-latency
- VRAM-efficient
- Optimized for real-time interaction
---
### 🗣️ Speech-to-Text (STT)
- Powered by Faster-Whisper
- Fully local and offline transcription
- Real-time microphone input
- Optimized for low latency and accuracy
---
### 🔊 Text-to-Speech (TTS) Architecture
Nova’s TTS system is designed for low latency, emotional expressiveness, and smooth playback — even on limited VRAM.
### 🧩 TTS Model
- Soprano-TTS (80M param, lightweight, local)
- GPU-accelerated using CUDA
- Emotion-aware generation via controlled parameters:
    - temperature
    - top_p
    - repetition_penalty
### 🧠 Text Processing
Output text is cleaned to remove patterns that commonly cause hallucinations or unstable TTS output:
- Ellipses (..., ……)
- Stutters (I...I'll)
- Excess punctuation
- Newlines and malformed tokens
### ⚙️ Chunking + Streaming System (Producer–Consumer)
Nova does not generate and play audio in a blocking way. Instead, she uses a producer–consumer threading architecture.
1. **Chunking** : Response text is split into natural sentence chunks to prevent long generations and enable early playback.
2. **Producer Thread (Audio Generation)** : Generates audio chunks sequentially and pushes them into a shared queue.
3. **Consumer Thread (Audio Streaming)** : Continuously reads from the queue and streams to the output device. Playback begins before full generation completes.
#### ✅ Results: Low perceived latency, natural pauses, and stable audio.
---
### 🎭 Emotional Expression System
Each LLM response includes an emotion tag that controls:
- 🎙️ Voice generation parameters
- 🧍 Facial expressions
- 🕺 Idle animations
#### **Behavior** : Emotion is applied at speech start and automatically released when playback ends.
---
### 🧍 3D Avatar Control (VMC Protocol)
- Uses **VMC / VSeeFace** protocol
- Sends real-time data for:
    - Facial expressions
    - Head movement
    - Emotional states
- Avatar reacts synchronously with voice and emotion
---
### 🎧 Audio Routing & Lip-Sync
- Audio output routed through **Virtual Audio Cable**
- VSeeFace uses the virtual cable as microphone **input**
- Enables accurate **real-time lip-sync**
---
### 🕒 Time Awareness
- Natural language date & time awareness
- Conversations and memories are timestamped
- Nova can reference time contextually
---
### 🤖 Agentic Abilities
**Nova can perform real system actions based on user intent:**
- 🎵 Play songs on YouTube (via songs.json)
- 🌐 Open websites (Google, YouTube, etc.)
- 🗂️ Perform basic file operations
- 🧠 Decide when to act vs respond conversationally
> ⚠️ Some agentic actions (e.g., file operations) are intentionally limited and rule-based to prevent unintended behavior.
#### **All agentic logic is:** Fully local, rule-based, and explicitly triggered.

## 💻 System Requirements
### Hardware
- **NVIDIA GPU:** (4–6 GB VRAM minimum)
## 🧪 Development & Minimum Hardware Target

Project Nova was **designed, developed, tested, and optimized** on the following hardware:

- **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 2050  
- **VRAM:** 4 GB  
- **CUDA:** Enabled  
- **Platform:** Windows

This configuration represents the **minimum recommended hardware** to run Project Nova smoothly with:

- Local LLM inference (Phi-3.5 fine-tuned, quantized)
- GPU-accelerated TTS
- Real-time speech recognition
- Avatar control via VMC
- Concurrent agentic features

All architectural decisions — including **model selection, quantization, chunked TTS streaming, and producer–consumer threading** — were made specifically to ensure stable performance within a **4 GB VRAM constraint**.

> If the project runs reliably on this system, it is expected to scale better on higher-end GPUs.

### Software
- Windows (recommended)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (recommended)
- [CUDA Toolkit: (12.x or newer)](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
- NVIDIA Drivers
- [VSeeFace](https://www.vseeface.icu/#download)
